        <h2>Dear Love,</h2>
        <p>
            Happy Valentine's Day, love! Also, belated happy anniversary! 
            I honestly do not know if this website will work hahaha T__T 
            but then, it's the thought that counts! joke. Love, I am really happy that I get to celebrate
            special occasions with you. I am used to celebrating them with daddy lang, but now I realized 
            na I am truly a woman na as I spend it with the man of my life na hehe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Love, thank you for making me feel special! You may not know, but your presence alone can complete my day.
            I love it whenever I see you from afar. Pag nag m-meet tayo, it's funny na ikaw lang lagi kong nakikita
            agad, then yung paligid mo is super labo hahaha. I love seeing your smile whenever you will salubong me.
            You make me love the act of loving you palagi. Thank you for allowing me to share your life with me! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I just want you to know that hindi ako mapapagod to do simple things for you. Those are small gestures that I
            can think of para ma reciprocate yung peace, love, and joy na nabibigay mo sa akin. I would always choose to take risks and 
            try new things for us. I loved learning to cook, prepare food, write letters, be creative, etc. because of you hehe. And I know
            that when the time comes, mas marami pa tayong magagawa together. Want ko na silang maranasan with you but no pressure for us! 
            God already has plans for our relationship, and I just pray that it aligns with our prayers too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, thank you for inspiring me. I know naman na you are aware of how goal-oriented and competitive I am sa acads; but believe
            it or not, you pushed me to be the best. Kaya nagustuhan kita eh! You, wearing a toga, as a profile picture made me fall in love. ugh.
            Whenever you give me a "good luck" sa school, you also remind me that someone is out there believing in me genuinely. There is someone
            who supports me because I can, not just because I have to. Thank you for making my life lighter. Thank you for helping me carry some
            baggage that cause me a hard time in life. You gave me a reason to do well kahit everything starts to feel like an obligation na lang.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a lot of "thank yous" to say pa. But one letter will never be enough.
            Thank you for being you. Thank you for loving me.  
            Continue exploring life with me, okay? 
            To more samgyup, coffee dates, McDo lunch, Mobile Legends games, photobooths, and "I love yous".
        </p>
        <p>
            Forever yours,  
            <br>ðŸ’– Allyssa
